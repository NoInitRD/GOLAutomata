# GOLAutomata
Conway's game of life, a cellular automaton.

This program contains cells on a grid that abide by the following rules:

-Dead cells with three neighbors become alive.
-Live cells with two or three neighbors survive.
-Live cells with more than three neighbors die.
-Live cells with less than two neighbors die.

These simple rules create colonies of cells that produce amazing patterns.
It was created by English mathematician John Horton Conway, in 1970.
